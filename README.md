# Paimon's journey: a jumpastart-daydream game

![image](/plush.png)

Paimon's journey is a simple platformer game where paimon jouneys through various areas in Teyvat and, in true Paimon fashion, eats a whole ton of food XD

You can run around and jump at free will:<br>

You can eat food, to gain hearts:<br>

You can also take damage of course, and find the ðŸš© to win the game!


**Currently the game has:**

* Celestia
* Mondstadt
* Basic mechanics for winning, losing, food, and simple static asmoday cubes

I hope to both make the game a bit prettier and more pixel-style as well as add more regions (Liyue, Inazuma, Sumeru, Fontaine, etc). I also want to improve the mechanics and the animations, but I haven't been able to do that yet and I do need to get this submitted, so for now it's this basic stuff :D
